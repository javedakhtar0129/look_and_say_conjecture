# Look And Say Conjecture

Making a small project on studying various analysis on the look and say
algorithm.

### Roadmap:
1. Code from scratch to create tables for numeric and binary numbers.
2. Retrieve information such as length of sequence,Ratio of frequency of ones and zeroes.
2. Using NN to create blocks and create a directional maps of subsequences which are optimal and are valid on the 
   whole dataset.
3. Compare to subsequences or blocks made in various encoding algorithms such as Gzip,Lz77(and similar),huffman's 
   encoding and etc.

##### Later: 
1. Use Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors to create a matrix of subsequences and try to understand matrix projections 
   in the rowspace.
2. Find a suitable visualisation to plot any findings(if found any)

#### Note: 
You may read and optimize the code and add further insights to it.
I'll slowly keep adding and making changes here.
Do reach out if any queries around it.
