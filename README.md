# Look And Say Conjecture

Making a small project on studying various analysis on the look and say
algorithm.

### Roadmap:
1. Code from scratch to create tables for numeric and binary numbers.
2. Using blocks to create directional maps for obtaining next in sequence number. 
3. Use matrices and Eigenvectors 
4. Check if it has anything to do with Matrix Projections in the rowspace.
4. Find a suitable visualisation to plot any findings(if found any)

#### Note: 
You may read and optimize the code and add further insights to it.
I'll slowly keep adding and making changes here.
Do reach out if any queries around it.
